This repository is a collection of tools, scripts, labs, and research related to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, covering how these attacks work, how to simulate them in controlled environments, and how to detect and prevent them.

🔍 Topics Covered:
🌐 ARP Spoofing & DNS Spoofing Attacks

🔐 HTTPS Interception & SSL Stripping (e.g., with Bettercap, mitmproxy)

🧪 Lab Setup for MITM Testing (Kali Linux, Virtual LANs, Wi-Fi APs)

🐍 Python Scripts for Packet Manipulation (Scapy)

🛡️ Detection & Defense Techniques (IDS rules, certificate pinning, firewall configurations)

📚 Case Studies on MITM Attacks in the Wild
